Jekyll is expecting new posts to show up as a file under _/posts with a file name "YYYY-MM-DD-title.markup". Also your file's content should start like this:
```
---
layout: post
title: <Post's title>
category: <Post's category>
tags: [ 'tag' ]
---
```
After this header you can start writing your post using Markdown.
