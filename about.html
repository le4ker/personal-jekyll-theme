<h2>About</h2>

Iosif, or __Joseph__, as he likes being called, is a
__Machine Learning__ professional specialised in __GIS technologies__. But,
first and foremost, he is an **Engineer** who enjoys planning and building 
projects from the ground up.

During his studying at the School of Spatial Planning and Development
Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, he learned how to
deeply analyze and evaluate the living space. He learned how the elaborate
search for weaknesses can prove most valuable for the design of developmental
policies.



Github's Octocat was designed by Simon Oxley, alongside the white bird Twitter
used (before they received a proper logo) as part of a usual routine of cranking
out images for iStock. GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion
that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much
like the octopuss... except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has
been the octocat since then.

  Octocat is Github's logo and trademark and here is used to illustrate a
  fictional character (John Smith) that used the *{ Personal }* Jekyll Theme to
  build his website.
