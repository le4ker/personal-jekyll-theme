Open an Issue in order to file a bug or [suggest](https://github.com/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme/issues/42) a new feature

If you want to close the issue:

1. Fork the repository and work on the fix or the feature. Don't forget to add you name in the CONTRIBUTORS file, no matter how small is your fix, even if it's a typo :wink:
2. Open a Pull Request with commits mentioning which issue are they fixing by adding in their description "Fixes #IssueNumber", in order to auto-resolve the issues after the Pull Request is merged into the master branch.
3. In case you want to get your Pull Request in the master branch quickly, consider adding a screenshot of before and after your fix.
4. Consider joining our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/PanosSakkos/personal-jekyll-theme) channel in order to make our communication easier.

A few simple rules that have to be followed:

1. No tabs allowed, two spaces should be used instead.
2. If you are adding a new feature, update the respective documentation post.
3. Make sure to test your changes on the mobile rendering as well. It's as important as the desktop view.
4. Make sure that after your changes the website is responsive, with respect to performance. There should be no lagging and make sure that this is the case when using it in a weak mobile client.
5. Squash your commits into one commit per ressolved issue.
